        <h2 align='center'>TODAY'S PANCHANG</h2>
        <p>Panchang is the astrological daily calendar based on the Indian calendar. Daily panchang is one of the most sought Vedic astrology concepts, which conceptualise the day's planetary position to determine auspicious tithis, timing, festivals, vrats, etc. Using this information, a person can choose whether or not to begin or accomplish a particular task after carefully studying the favourability or unfavorability of the planets ruling the particular task. It is a belief among people that doing a thing or two as per Today's panchang timings brings good luck and helps in the accomplishment of the tasks with ease.

At Astrotalk, a Panchang calendar is produced by a team of the best astrologers of India. The Daily Panchang details the various astrological elements of the day and based on the same, the level of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness is decided. Right from Today's sunrise time to today's sunset time, Panchang helps you find all of it as per your convenience.

Majorly, Panchang is used to get detail of five aspects. These five aspects are - day of the week (vaar); tithi or the lunar day; nakshatra or the constellation; yoga; and karan. With the change in time and date, all of these compartments that make the panchang also change. And thus it’s necessary to keep oneself updated about them for various reasons.

</p>
1.<h3>Vaar</h3>
<p>Vaar, also called Din, is the easiest thing to understand when considering Panchang reading. Vaar means the day of the week. Each day of the week does not just differ by its name but is also ruled by a different astrological planet. Knowing what planet is ruling what day helps you in understanding what kind of effect the day can have on you. Below are the names of the day and in the bracket is the planet that rules that particular day. 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sunday (Sun)</li>
  <li>Monday (Moon)</li>
  <li>Tuesday (Mars)</li>
  <li>Wednesday (Mercury)</li>
  <li>Thursday (Jupiter)</li>
  <li>Friday (Venus)</li>
  <li>Saturday (Saturn)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tithi </h3>
<p>Tithi (along with Paksha) is the day according to the Hindu lunar calendar. An astrologer would tell you that the Hindu lunar calendar consists of a dark and a bright fortnight also called paksha. When the moon completes 12 degrees of its movement on the Sun, it is called a Tithi or Hindu lunar day. 

All in all, there are as many as 30 tithis in a lunar month. When considering Tithis, they either belong to Shukl Paksha or Krishna paksha. In astrology, the beginning and end of a Tithi depends upon the degree of the Moon from that of the Sun. Hence a tithi can start or end at any time of the day. There are several rituals associated with Tithis. Most of the festivals fall on the new moon day (Amavasya) or the full moon day (Poornima).

</p>
<p>The Hindu Tithis are classified into five types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nanda Tithi - for happiness and joy</li>
<li>Bhadra Tithi - is considered good for starting any new work</li>
  <li>Jaya Tithi - the tithi helps you win over your enemies</li>
  <li>Rikta Tithi - most of the time, this tithi is ignored as it is not considered good for any important work.</li>
  <li>Poorna Tithi - very favourable to complete all kinds of job</li>
</ol>
<h3>Nakshatra</h3>
<p>Another important constituent of Today's panchang is Nakshatra. For the unaware, nakshatras are nothing but constellations donning the sky. There are as many as 27 Nakshatras in astrology and all of them are ruled by some God. Naksahstra were invented by the Vedic astrologer to simply further divide the 12 zodiac signs into 27 parts for better reading and categorising their different aspects. Nakshatra most of the time is considered the most important element of Panchang reading.  

When we divide the 12 zodiac signs into 27 nakshatras, each nakshatra contains thirteen degrees and twenty minutes of the zodiac. You could be born in any of the 27 nakshatras as nakshatras change every one day. Nakshatra are divided into three types: Deva, Manuj and Rakshas. As the name suggests, Rakshas nakshatras and inauspicious while the remaining bring auspicious results for the native most of the time. </p>
     <p/>

  <h3>Yoga</h3>
<p>In Panchang, the literal meaning of the word ‘Yoga’ is addition. a Yoga is derived from the addition of the Sun's and Moon's position in the Zodiac. Each yoga specifies some characteristic of the persona. There are 27 ‘Yogas’, in Panchang. The first yog (Viskumbh) ends when the sum is 13°20'. Second Yog ( Priti) ends when it is 26°40' and so on.

Vaidhriti and Vyatipaat Yogas are mostly avoided when considering performing an auspicious act. Out of the remaining Yogas, the first three Ghatis of Vajra and Vishkumbha, the first half of Parigh, the first five ghatis of Shool, the first nine ghatis of Vyaghat, and the first nine ghatis of Gand and Atigand are to be discarded for all the auspicious acts. A Ghati is an ancient time measurement system, A Ghati is equivalent to the modern 24 Minutes.

</p>
<p>There are 27 yogas, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vishakumbha - Achieving </li>
<li>Preeti -  Happy  </li>

<h3>Karna</h3>
<p>Half of Tithi is called `Karna'. In each Tithi, there are two Karans and in total, we have 11 Karnas in total. Four of them occur just once a month and are called the Fixed Karanas: Kintughna, Chatushpada, Sakuni and Naga.</p>
<br>
</br>
      <p>The other seven are movable Karanas. They follow one another in a fixed rotation: Bava, Balava, Kaulava, Taitila, Gara, Vanija and Vishti.
